      <p>Hi am and Josh and I like to code things.</p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am a professional software engineer proficient in Typescript, Java, Go
        and Python and familiar with C. In my work I have become experienced
        with a number of cloud (GCP and AWS) and dev-ops tools, in addition to
        multiple frontend and backend frameworks (including but not limited to
        React, Next.js, Springboot, Bootstrap, TailwindCSS and GoFiber) along
        with a number of data (PySpark and Pandas) and non data focused Python
        libraries.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        If you are visiting from my CV or job application I'd be glad to discuss
        further details of these skills and experience (;))
      </p>
      <br />
      {/*ToDo: Add links for website frontend directly and for projects*/}
      <p>
        I also like to code things for the fun of it and to learn. While I
        understand and utilise the value of AI tooling for productivity in
        professional software development in the modern age, my personal
        projects are done the old fashioned way for two reasons 1) To learn and
        deeply understand the tools I am using, making development reflexive and
        easing debugging by having a deeper understanding of the core workings
        of the technologies I am using and 2) Because it is FUN!. This website
        is one of my larger projects, you can find further information about it
        here, and my other projects here.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of coding I am a keen runner and triathlete, hoping to one day
        complete an IronMan 70.3. I am also an avid home cook (after having
        worked in this industry professionally) and enjoy thinking up new
        recipes and trying them out on my partner and friends. I plan on
        developing a system to manage these soon (watch this space!)
      </p>

      {/*ToDo: Thesis link once done */}
      <p>
        My academic background is in theoretical physics and I enjoy keeping up
        to date in new developments in the field, particularly around the focus
        of my thesis: Graphene.

        you enjoy exploring this site!
