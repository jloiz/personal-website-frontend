      <p>
        This project is a lightweight CRUD web application built to strengthen
        my familiarity with Go and its broader ecosystem. It features a GoFiber
        HTTP server paired with a PostgreSQL database, exposing create, read,
        update, and delete API endpoints.
      </p>
      <p>
        A key focus of the project was learning and applying safe, maintainable
        database practices, including secure credential handling, unique key
        generation, and thoughtful schema design. I also emphasised user‑centric
        API behaviour by returning meaningful responses and clear error
        messaging.
      </p>
      <p>
        This application serves as a foundational stepping stone for future
        backend and database‑driven projects, providing a solid baseline for
        more advanced Go web services.
      </p>
      <p>The full implementation is available via the GitHub link.</p>
