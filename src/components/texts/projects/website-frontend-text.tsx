        This project is a fully custom Next.js application built with HeroUI and
        Tailwind CSS 4.0. It is an actively maintained, production‑deployed site
        that I continue to enhance as time allows.
      </p>
      <p>
        To deepen my understanding of the underlying technologies, I opted for a
        fully manual setup rather than relying on pre‑configured CLI
        scaffolding. This approach provided hands‑on experience with the core
        tooling and architecture of a modern React‑based web application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project also offered the opportunity to design the interface from a
        true greenfield starting point, focusing on responsive layouts and
        mobile‑first styling.

        Key skills demonstrated:
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>
            Tailwind CSS specificity and component customization, particularly
            when extending HeroUI components
          </li>
          <li>Hosting and DNS configuration for a production deployment</li>
          <li>
            Custom SVG design and integration, including bespoke graphics
            featured on the homepage
          </li>
          <li>Google Fonts integration and typography optimization</li>
          <li>
            Greenfield development, from initial structure to UI implementation
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        Planned future enhancements include implementing a backend to support
        dynamic content and building a lightweight CMS for managing articles and
        documents, which will be documented as a separate project. You can
        explore the full codebase via the GitHub link.
